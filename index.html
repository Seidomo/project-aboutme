        <h2>Biography</h2>
        <p> Hello. My name is Sang. This page is provided to help you learn more about me. Before I start with a quick bio, I want to thank you for taking the time to visit. </p>
        <p> I currently reside in Seattle, WA. I have been a transplant to the Pacific Northwest (PNW) since 2015. My wife and I both work in the technology sector and have couple of rug rats in tow. I am currently taking some time off from the industry to tackle personal projects (e.g. home improvement) and growth (e.g. learning to code!). Prior to the tech industry, I served active duty in the U.S. Air Force for about 10 years. </P>

      <section class="goals"> <!-- This is the Goals section: it describes my goal for being part of code fellows-->
        <h2>Why is Sang in Code Fellows (Goals)</h2>
        <p> My primary goal in attending Code Fellows is to build my software development technical skills. I have been working with software (and hardware) developers but in order to better understand the "under the hood" technology, I wanted to get hands-on to learn the fundamentals. </p>
        <p> My secondary goal is to better understand the world of coding bootcamps. As a transitioning veteran and someone who believes in life-long learning, I believe that careers in tech offers one of the best opportunities for veterans. I believe it's a good fit because veterans bring highly transferrable skills to the industry as well (acknowledging that I may be biased). I want to be able to credibly advise and counsel transitioning veterans that reach out to me. This is especially poignant since many have earned educational benefits through their service and federal organizations (e.g. VA) are funding "non-degree programs", such as coding bootcamps, as viable transition pipelines.</p>
