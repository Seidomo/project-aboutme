# LAB - 02

## Project "About Me"
A web page that provides information about its author using a yes/no Q&A. The webpage asks for the user's name which is used to customize the responses back to the user using an *alert* dialog box. It provides 5 yes/no question prompts to the user, and then provides the user with feedback on their answer.

## Reflections and Comments
+ Building on 102; I found the exercise of "by the numbers" (military slang) approach to HTML/CSS/JS. As an example, just the introducion of reset.css to forego the basic formatting offered by browser to make sure I, as a developer, have 'full control' of the style and use CSS to execute that style was very instructive and insightful. 
+ One thing that I have **not** been doing is reviewing the end of chapter code examples in detail -- I go back to them, if time permits, but in trying to get the core reading in, I have been using it as a stretch goal. Based on my most recent reading, however, I need to find a way to incorporate this into my core reading.
+ I misunderstood part of the instruction about the customized greeting and farewell message. It was good to explore trying to incorporate that onto the page (e.g. I tried with using `document.write()` but was not able to do it.  I was thankful for the 15 minute rule, so I didn't spend too much time chasing that rabbit hole after confirming with the TA that this was not part of the assignment.
+ I estimated about 4 hours to complete the lab prior to staring it and it took about that long (cumulatively, not one straight shot).
