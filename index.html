        <h2>Biography</h2>
        <p> Hello. My name is Sang and this page is provided to help you learn more about me through a series of Q&As. Before I provide a short bio, I want to thank you for taking the time to visit and playing along. </p>
        <p> I currently reside in Seattle, WA. I have been a transplant to the Pacific Northwest (PNW) since 2015. My wife and I both work in the technology sector, but I am currently taking some time off to tackle personal projects and grow in areas that I have been wanting to for some time (e.g. home improvememnt, learning how to code!).</p>
        <P> Prior to the tech industry, I served in the U.S. Air Force and I did that for about 10 years. It was truly an honor and a privilege to serve.</P>

        <h2>Education History</h2>
        <p>I have been extremely lucky and fortunate to have had the opportunity to pursue higher education. However, I believe that learning is a life-long pursuit and one is <i>never</i> truly "done". </p>

          <li>Carnegie-Mellon University, MBA (2014)</li>
          <li>Georgia Institute of Technology, BS (2000)</li>

      <section class="goals"> <!-- This is the Goals section: it describes my goal for being part of code fellows-->
        <h2>Code Fellows Goals</h2>
        <p> My primary goal in attending Code Fellows is to build my software development technical skills. I have been working with software (and hardware) developers but in order to better understand the "under the hood" technology, I wanted to get hands-on to learn the fundamentals. </p>
        <p> My secondary goal is to better understand the world of coding bootcamps. As a transitioning veteran and someone who believes in life-long learning, I believe that careers in tech offers the best transition for veterans and I want to be able to advise and counsel those that reach out to me so I can speak more credibly; especially since federal organizations (e.g. VA) is recognizing coding bootcamps as viable transition pipeline.</p>
